   - Fallback values provided where appropriate

3. **Backdrop Filter**:
   - Implemented with fallback background color
   - Progressive enhancement approach used

4. **Touch vs Hover Interactions**:
   - Comprehensive `@media (hover: none)` queries
   - Separate interaction patterns for touch devices
   - No hover states "stuck" on touch devices
